The purpose of this study is to forecast avocado prices using historical sales data. Avocado prices fluctuate seasonally, and understanding these variations can significantly improve sales strategies and revenue forecasts. The dataset used in this project contains weekly retail scan data for 2018, featuring average prices, sales volumes, types (conventional or organic), and specifics about the sold avocado units with PLU 4046, 4225, and 4770. The price prediction task is approached using Prophet, an open-source library developed by Facebook's Core Data Science team well-suited for datasets with strong seasonal patterns.

II. Detailed Explanation of the Code
The code begins by importing necessary libraries and loading the data from a CSV file. The data is explored through several visualizations, including time-series plots of average prices and counts of observations per region and year.
Next, the data is prepared for modelling by selecting the necessary columns (Date and AveragePrice) and renaming them according to Prophet's requirements (ds and y). The Prophet model is then initialized and fitted to the data.
The forecasting step involves creating a future dataframe for the next 365 days and predicting prices for these dates. The forecast is then plotted to visualize the expected trend and uncertainty intervals.
The process is repeated for a specific region ('West') to demonstrate region-specific forecasting, culminating in a decomposition of the forecast into its individual components.

III. Justification and Analytical Insights
The choice of Prophet for this forecasting task is primarily due to its capability to handle time-series data with strong seasonal patterns. It implements a robust additive regression model incorporating yearly and weekly seasonal components, change points detection for trends, and holiday effects, making it ideal for avocado price prediction given the evident seasonal and annual price variations.
The model's parameters were kept at default values due to Prophet's in-built capabilities to fit data and identify trend change points automatically. This self-tuning feature reduces the need for manual parameter tweaking and benefits us by providing a reasonable model fit out of the box.
The decision to carry out region-specific forecasting allows us to capture local trends and patterns, which would be lost in a global model. Different regions might uniquely influence avocado prices due to local supply-demand dynamics, weather conditions, etc. Hence, region-specific forecasting provides a more granular and potentially accurate picture.
Regarding data preparation, only the 'Date' and 'AveragePrice' columns were selected for the Prophet model. Although the dataset contains features such as 'type', 'Total Volume', and individual PLU codes, they were not considered due to Prophet's univariate nature, which only allows for using a single predictor.

IV. Conclusion
this study showcases the efficacy of using the Prophet model for predicting avocado prices on a national and regional scale. The results can guide stakeholders to make informed decisions based on anticipated price fluctuations, optimizing sales strategies and revenue forecasts.
