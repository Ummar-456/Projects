Introduction
The project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the total dollar amount customers are willing to pay to purchase a car. The model leverages Customer Name, Customer E-mail, Country, Gender, Age, Annual Salary, Credit Card Debt, and Net Worth. The output of the model is the expected Car Purchase Amount.

Methodology
The Python programming language and essential machine learning libraries such as pandas, sklearn, seaborn, and keras were used for data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
The dataset was initially loaded into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file. The dataset was examined for its structure and content. Following that, a visual exploration was performed using seaborn's pairplot to understand the relationships among the variables.
The features and target variables were prepared by segregating relevant columns. Feature matrix X consisted of all columns except customer-specific identifiers (name and e-mail) and the target variable (Car Purchase Amount). The country was also dropped as the model was focused on individual financial attributes rather than geographical differences.
The data was scaled using MinMaxScaler, which transformed the data into a range between 0 and 1. This was performed to prevent variables with larger scales from overpowering those with smaller scales, a common requirement in neural network models.
The data was split into training and testing sets, with 85% for training and 15% for testing. The split was determined based on a general rule of thumb, balancing the need for training data against the need for a robust validation dataset.
The model for this problem was a sequential neural network built using Keras. The model consisted of two hidden layers and an output layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layers was set at 15. The size of the input and output layers influenced the choice. The activation function for the hidden layers was 'ReLU', popular for its ability to deal with the vanishing gradient problem, while for the output layer, 'linear' activation was chosen as the problem was regression-based.
The model was compiled using the 'Adam' optimizer and 'Mean Squared Error' as the loss function, common choices for regression problems.
The model was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 50 and a validation split of 0.2. The number of epochs and batch size were chosen after initial runs, balancing model performance and computational efficiency. The validation split was used for fine-tuning the model.

Results and Discussion
The model's performance was evaluated using a training and validation loss plot. The plot enabled visualization of the model's learning process and helped identify overfitting or underfitting scenarios.
A test data sample was used to predict the Car Purchase Amount. The prediction provided a practical application of the model and validated its usability.

Conclusion
The project successfully created a model based on customer features to predict car purchase amounts. Despite the model's simplicity, it shows promising results and provides a good starting point. Further improvements can be made by exploring different model architectures, fine-tuning model parameters, and applying feature engineering or selection techniques.
