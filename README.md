This Python script starts by importing the necessary data manipulation, visualization, and forecasting libraries. It then loads crime data of Chicago for the years 2005-2017, divided into three segments. After loading, it combines these datasets, providing a comprehensive overview of crimes committed over these years.
The script then moves to explore the dataset by displaying the first few records and the last ten records and uses a heatmap to visualize the missing data points in the dataset. This helps in understanding the overall structure of the data and identifying any issues related to missing data that could affect subsequent analysis.
The next part of the code is dedicated to data pre-processing. It drops certain columns not required for the final analysis and prediction. These dropped columns include 'Unnamed: 0', 'Case Number', 'ID', 'IUCR',' X Coordinate', 'Y Coordinate', 'Updated On', 'Year', 'FBI Code', 'Beat', 'Ward', 'Community Area', 'Location',' District', 'Latitude',' Longitude'. The 'Date' column is transformed into the datetime format and set as the dataframe's index.
Then the code proceeds to conduct exploratory data analysis. It determines and visualizes the count of each type of crime and identifies the top 15 types of crimes and their locations. The script also resamples the crime data annually, monthly, daily, and quarterly to visualize trends in crime counts over different periods.
After this, the data is prepared for forecasting. The data is again resampled monthly, and the columns are renamed for compatibility with the Prophet library. The script then initializes and fits a Prophet model on the processed data to predict crime rates for the following 720 periods (days).
In choosing Prophet for this task, the simplicity and robustness of the model for time-series forecasting are considered. Despite its ease of use, Prophet offers flexibility to adjust various parameters for handling trends and seasonality, allowing for a more refined model with better forecasts. In this particular script, the default values of these parameters are used as it provides a good starting point. However, depending on the prediction performance, they could be adjusted to tune the model to yield better results. These adjustable parameters include 'changepoint_prior_scale' and 'seasonality_prior_scale', which control the model's sensitivity to changes in trend and seasonality, respectively.
This script provides a comprehensive workflow for analyzing crime data and predicting future crime rates. It encapsulates the critical steps of any data analysis process, including data loading, exploration, pre-processing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modelling. The choices made in the script for the dropped columns, visualization, model selection, and parameter settings are all justified by the need to provide meaningful insights and accurate predictions from the data.
