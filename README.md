The given script classifies emails into 'spam' and 'ham' (non-spam). The script starts by loading necessary libraries and reading the data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. Initial exploratory analysis is done by inspecting the first and last few rows, understanding the data shape, summarizing the data, and exploring data types.
The script then visualizes the data to understand the distribution of spam and ham emails in the dataset. It calculates and displays the percentages of spam and ham emails, followed by a bar plot using seaborn's countplot function.
In the data preprocessing phase, the script employs the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert the email text into a matrix of token counts. This process converts the text into a form understandable by the machine learning model. It also extracts the labels (spam or not) into a separate variable.
Following this, the script creates a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, a suitable model for classification with discrete features such as word counts for text classification. The model is then fitted with the processed text and labels. To illustrate a prediction, the script demonstrates the model's prediction on two simple test samples.
The script then splits the data into training and test sets. Another Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is created and trained on the training data. The model performance is evaluated by making training and test set predictions. The performance metrics include confusion matrices and a classification report showing precision, recall, and F1-score.
Report:
The given Python script classifies emails as 'spam' or 'ham' using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. The Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was chosen due to its suitability for discrete data and its performance on text data. It assumes that all features (words in this case) are independent, an assumption often called "naive". Despite this naivety, in practice, it performs well in many complex real-world situations.
The choice to use the CountVectorizer was due to the need to convert text data into a numerical format that the machine learning algorithm could understand. CountVectorizer does this by converting the text into a matrix of token counts. It creates a vocabulary from all the unique words in the text and counts the occurrences of these words in each text sample. This gives a numerical representation of the text that can be used in the model.
In terms of model parameters, the default parameters were used for the Multinomial Naive Bayes model. This was due to a preliminary analysis, but a more robust approach could involve parameter tuning using methods such as grid search or random search to find the optimal parameters that yield the best model performance. Similarly, for the CountVectorizer, the parameters were left as default, which means all words were considered, and no stop words were removed. Considerations could be made in a more detailed analysis to remove stop words or use techniques such as stemming or lemmatizing.
The script uses a simple train-test split for model evaluation. An 80-20 split was chosen, a common choice providing a balance between having sufficient data for training the model and enough data left for testing.
In conclusion, the script does an excellent job of classifying spam emails using a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. However, parameter tuning, and further text preprocessing could be considered for a more robust model.
